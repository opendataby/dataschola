During 1995-1996~ BeJarusian scientists in collaboration with government ministries officials and other authorities whose activities are directly connected with natural resources use and management analysed the state of the biological resources of the country and developed the National Strategy and Action Plan for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biodiversity in the Republic of Belarus. The above documents were approved by Resolution No.789 of the Cabinet of Ministers on 26 June 1997. These documents need to be translated in English so that the Republic of Belarus can exchange her experiences with other countries in implementing the Convention and discuss funding possibilities with donor governments and institutions. The Government has also expressed the wish to receive assistance to convene a national workshop to publicize the principles and objectives of the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan to representatives of a broad range of stakeholders in order to determine priority measures, including integration of biodiversity conservation and sustainable use concerns into sectoral plans for major sectors such as agriculture, forestry and wetlands management, for which adequate funding should be sought for implementation. The Government of Belarus is also seeking assistance for the preparation of the first national report to the Convention based on the information contained in the national biodiversity strategy and action plan. The above mentioned workshop planned for representatives of Ininistries, local authorities, scientific and research institutions and nongovernmental environmental organizations (NGOs) to publicize the ~SAP will also provide a forum to agree on the contents of the first national report to the Convention.

There are four components to the project. Component one: construction of a mechanical waste separation treatment facility in the City of Grodno. This component is estimated to cost US$ 37 million, financed by a World Bank loan. Funds will finance construction of a 120,000 ton/year modern mechanical separation plant to recover recyclable materials from commercial and household waste. Component two: waste separation management improvements. This component is estimated to cost US$4.0 million, financed from Government budget. The objective is to sequence improvements to separate waste at source so the mechanical solid waste separation facility receives higher-quality dry input materials to process. Component three: POPs stockpile management. This component will cost an estimated US$26.7 million: US$5.5 million financed by a global environment facility (GEF) grant; US$20.6 million financed from Government and enterprise resources; and the balance from international sources such as United Nation Development Program (UNDP), Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA), North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).

Respectively, there is one Service Delivery Area: Management of drugresistant tuberculosis.The proposal aims at scaling up the management  of DR-TB in the country by enrolling a higher number of patients in second-line treatment according to the need. It is foreseen to enrol a total of 2,100 MDR-TB patients over five years from the civilian and penitentiary sectors. The grant is built to support the country’s second application to  the Green Light Committee for expansion of the treatment cohort, which will be submitted by September 2009. The accomplishment of the grant’s Objective will be ensured through strengthening human and infrastructural capacities, upgrading the TB laboratory services and provision of up-to-date treatment of DR-TB cases with appropriate patient support to ensure adherence. The proposal has a country-wide scope and covers the needs of both civilian and penitentiary sectors. It targets all TB patients in the country (about 28,000 over 5 years); a specific group to be reached by the grant are DR-TB patients. The proposed Activities are organized in the following groups:  1. Strengthening national capacities for management of drug-resistant TB 2. Diagnosis of drug-resistant TB cases 3. Treatment of drug-resistant TB cases with patient support 4. Operational research on drug-resistant TB. The proposal aims at expanding access to diagnosis and treatment of DR-TB: all TB patients will have access to drug susceptibility testing and all patients diagnosed with DR-TB will have access to second line treatment. It is expected that on a longer run, the grant will contribute to improving the key TB outcome indicators (case detection rate  and treatment success rate) and decreasing the prevalence of MDR-TB.",BLR-S10-G04-T,,122,Basic health,12250,Infectious & Parasitic disease control,12182.01|12110.03|15130.06|12250.04,"All general medical research activities|Institution capacity building, Health general|Law enforcement and crime prevention|Tuberculosis control",Grant,,,,,12250,Infectious & Parasitic disease control,12719005,0,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,Local Fund Agent is: KPMG; Commitment date is the date grant signed rather than the date of board approval.,Screen Scrape Adapter,http://portfolio.theglobalfund.org/Grant/Index/BLR-S10-G04-T?lang=en

The goal of the program is to reduce the burden of TB in Belarus, including scaling up the management of MDR-TB by enrolling higher number of patients in treatment with second-line drugs. The program will achieve full integration of the DOTS strategy in the practical work of the national healthcare system, and support the National TB Program (NTP) in Belarus from 2011 to 2014 by expanding the coverage and scope of the state-supported TB control activities.

The specific objectives of the project are to:-Estimate impact of recent tobacco taxes and prices increases in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus on smoking rates, revenues and household expenditures.-Estimate volumes of smuggling both ''into-the-country'' and ''out-of-country'' and their impact on revenue.-Compare different scenarios for separate tobacco tax increases for each country and for coordinated tax increases.-Develop arguments for tobacco tax increases both for decision makers and the media.-Encourage governments to implement coordinated, large tax increases.",106837,2012006837UAA2,151,"Government and civil society, general",15120,Public sector financial management,15120.03|12191.09,Tax assessment procedures|Drug and substance abuse control and counseling,ODA Grants,430,IV.2.

Developmental priorities of all these countries to be addressed in this project are related to high mortality rates, primarily due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). While high smoking rates are known to be the most prominent risk factor for NCDs, most of the tobacco control measures, if any, were implemented only quite recently in all three countries. The experiences in tobacco tax policies were, however, quite different.

The conference program is being developed around the overarching theme of building disaster resilient communities. Recent years have seen no shortage of reminders that improved management of natural hazards and the reduction of disaster risks must be given the highest priority. The need for a global disaster reduction strategy has been underscored by a string of disasters, most notably the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami which claimed over 250,000 lives, but also the earthquakes in Pakistan and Indonesia; persistent droughts in Africa; heat waves and fires in Europe; hurricanes in Central America and the United States; and landslides triggered by typhoons in South East Asia. ObjectivesThe primary objectives of the CRHNet are to: · Initiate the development of a Canadian inter-disciplinary and cross-sectoral network of researchers, academics and practitioners to enhance understanding of emergency management in all dimensions and help build Canadian capacity to deal effectively with threats and consequences from all hazards. · Create a Canadian annual forum for dialogue focusing on disaster risk reduction and facilitate policy formulation and adoption of best practices in Canada. · Provide a Canadian venue to learn from the experiences of other countries by inviting internationally reputed scholars, practitioners, and participants to the Symposium and to share Canadian experience and efforts in disaster reduction. Websitehttp://www.jibc.ca/crhnet/Expected Impact: · Decreased post-disaster losses and increased community resilience through implementation of community-based, best practices · Increased collaboration and development of strong national and international policies and strategies based on community capacity building and sustainable developmentExpected Outcomes: · Local and International presentations and dissemination of conference proceedings and knowledge · Change in practice based on research and lessons learned · Supportive and collaborative networks of researchers and practitioners · Improved CRHNet 2007 due to evaluation and carefully documented conference organizational materials · Introduction of new programs based on increased knowledge and awareness of global Network (via CRHNet site)Expected Outputs: · Conference Abstracts · Conference Presentations and Handouts (provided to delegates) · Delegate Contact Information · Conference Evaluation · CIDA Report · Web-based CIDA delegate Support Network (via CRHNet site)Countries: India (27.27%), Nepal (18.18%), Thailand (9.1%), Belarus (9.09%), Brazil (9.09%), Lebanon (9.09%), Sri Lanka (9.09%), Russian Fed.

In this context, a four-day introductory seminar Reform of the Prison System was held in Bratislava from 5 - 8 November 2013 within the multilateral program prison reform. Seminar was aimed both to conduct lectures and for the exchange of transformation and integration experience. Also selected Slovak detention facilities were visited. At the same time representatives of the six Eastern Partnership countries shared information about how their own prison systems function as well as they tried to identify areas where mutual consultations and cooperation can be established. Therefore EP countries sent representatives of governemntal and non-governmental sector.

Ob parni eksploziji v reaktorju št. 4, je bila notranjost reaktorja izpostavljena, kar je v ozra?je spustilo velike koli?ine radioaktivnega materiala. Radioaktivni oblak je najbolj ogrozil Rusijo, Belorusijo in Ukrajino. Posledice so vidne še danes in številni otroci se soo?ajo s težavami, ki so posledica bolezni dihal, kožnih obolenj ter poškodb gibal. Rde?i križ Slovenije projekt izvaja v sodelovanju z Ukrajinskim rde?im križem in Izvršnim odborom Ministrstva za izobraževanje regije Mogilev v Belorusiji. Otroci, ki so bili v program rehabilitacije v Mladinskem letoviš?u in zdraviliš?u Rde?ega križa Slovenije Debeli rti? vklju?eni v 2013 so bili vklju?eni v program respiratorne fizioterapije, katere namen je ve?ja predihanost plju? (zgornjih, srednjih in spodnjih predelov) in sprostitev, program hidroterapije, katere namen je revitalizirati, vzdrževati in povrniti zdravje organizmu in vaj za vzdržljivost kot na primer jutranji tek, pohod v Resslov gaj, nordijska hoja, trim steza s 17 postajami, vodna aerobika. Vaje za vzdržljivost pripomorejo k ve?ji kostni gostoti, krepitvi mišic, boljši gibljivosti ter pospešujejo sr?ni utrip.

Ob parni eksploziji v reaktorju št. 4, je bila notranjost reaktorja izpostavljena, kar je v ozra?je spustilo velike koli?ine radioaktivnega materiala. Radioaktivni oblak je najbolj ogrozil Rusijo, Belorusijo in Ukrajino. Posledice so vidne še danes in številni otroci se soo?ajo s težavami, ki so posledica bolezni dihal, kožnih obolenj ter poškodb gibal. Rde?i križ Slovenije projekt izvaja v sodelovanju z Ukrajinskim rde?im križem in Izvršnim odborom Ministrstva za izobraževanje regije Mogilev v Belorusiji. Otroci, ki so bili v program rehabilitacije v Mladinskem letoviš?u in zdraviliš?u Rde?ega križa Slovenije Debeli rti? vklju?eni v 2013 so bili vklju?eni v program respiratorne fizioterapije, katere namen je ve?ja predihanost plju? (zgornjih, srednjih in spodnjih predelov) in sprostitev, program hidroterapije, katere namen je revitalizirati, vzdrževati in povrniti zdravje organizmu in vaj za vzdržljivost kot na primer jutranji tek, pohod v Resslov gaj, nordijska hoja, trim steza s 17 postajami, vodna aerobika. Vaje za vzdržljivost pripomorejo k ve?ji kostni gostoti, krepitvi mišic, boljši gibljivosti ter pospešujejo sr?ni utrip.

In this context, a four-day introductory seminar Reform of the Prison System was held in Bratislava from 5 - 8 November 2013 within the multilateral program prison reform. Seminar was aimed both to conduct lectures and for the exchange of transformation and integration experience. Also selected Slovak detention facilities were visited. At the same time representatives of the six Eastern Partnership countries shared information about how their own prison systems function as well as they tried to identify areas where mutual consultations and cooperation can be established. Therefore EP countries sent representatives of governemntal and non-governmental sector.

To feed into this process, the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) is undertaking a comprehensive review of the TCPR to take stock of the effectiveness and results of the UN system's development cooperation during the 2005-07 period. The review will take into account the coordination structures and available capacity in the UN system to provide a comprehensive and appropriate response to developing countries' demands. It will also draw on the research papers prepared for the UN Panel on System-wide Coherence. UNDESA will undertake approximately ten research projects, varying from capacity building, national ownership, funding and the UN's evaluation function to human resources and relief to development transition. To do this, UNDESA is using existing evaluations and studies as its basis, complemented by consultations with a wide group of stakeholders both at country level and in New York. Results of the review will include an in-depth analysis of the TCPR's implementation, statistical data on UN system development funding and a series of analytical conference room papers covering various issues.Countries: Afghanistan TIS (.68%), Angola (.68%), Albania (.68%), Argentina (.68%), Armenia (.68%), Antigua/Barbuda (.68%), Azerbaijan Rep (.68%), Burundi (.68%), Benin (.68%), Burkina-Faso (.68%), Bangladesh (.68%), Bulgaria (.68%), Bosnia & Herz.

IEG has completed a Sourcebook of Indicative Principles and Standards for Evaluating Global and Regional Partnership Programs (GRPPs) under the auspices of the OECD/DAC Network on Development Evaluation. A Stakeholder Consultative Workshop held in Paris to review the Sourcebook also called for the preparation of a second, companion document of good-practice guidelines and examples for the GRPPs members. The good-practice guidelines and examples will be aimed specifically at evaluators of GRPPs. The purpose is to improve the quality of program-level evaluations of GRPPs in order to enhance the relevance and effectiveness of the programs. The document will provide good practices for applying generally accepted evaluation criteria (such as relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability) to the evaluation of GRPPs - along with positive examples from existing evaluations - in the light of the particular features of GRPPs. It will also provide good-practice guidelines and examples for assessing the more unique aspects of GRPPs such as their governance and management arrangements, their resource mobilization strategies, and their strategies for devolution or exit, as applicable.

ETC countries will have to commit themselves to macroeconomic reforms in order to benefit from EBRD loans. The Programme should yield benefits at the micro and macro level: At the macro level. the higher volume of local currency loans to the financial sector and to the corporate sector should reduce vulnerability to foreign exchange movements. resulting in lower insolvency risk and increased financial stability. At the micro level. the loans should help the local borrowers decrease their financial risk by matching liabilities to local currency revenues.

Belsat was created to fill an important part of the information gap – a lack of independent television programming focused on news about Belarus for Belarusian citizens. Other efforts such as ERB (backed by IREX as well), Radio Racija, RFE, DW, etc. began as external radio broadcasters although most now, and especially ERB, can be better called multimedia outlets using radio and internet to distribute news and information. But since television remains the primary source of news and information, Belsat has sought to fill that gap.IREX will work with Belsat to educate citizens on their rights to information, sources of uncensored information, and the benefits of a free and professional media. IREX will provide a sub grant to Belsat to produce and air Public Service Announcements (PSA) for a period of six months, and will work to improve the use of social media to distribute the PSAs and the broader message of the right to information.

Members of co-operatives have control of their organizations and are able to apply such experience to all aspects of their lives. Further, women are often at the heart of the most progressive developments by and within co-operatives and the larger social economy. Co-operatives are often regarded as important tools in addressing issues related to gender inequity.Expected Outcomes: Representatives that attended the conference will share the information they gathered with colleagues, students, and development agents in their own countries. Sharing such information can help others to avoid repeating mistakes, and provide guidance in promoting effective and relevant innovation in areas such as sustainable economic and community development, democracy, or gender equity.Expected Outputs: Delegates will immediately gain: - an opportunity to share their knowledge and experiences; - an opportunity to acquire new knowledge; - introduction to international colleagues and a chance to discuss common issues and perhaps common solutions to those issues; and, - an opportunity to develop a network of colleagues that can serve as a resource group in the future. Upon returning to their country of origin, delegates will be better equipped to affect sustainable positive change by applying the knowledge and understandings gained through participation in the conference. Lessons learned regarding how co-ops innovate to suit local conditions could prove valuable to offer guidance to those encountering similar challenges in their own countries.Countries: India (36.3%), Philippines (18.2%), Argentina (9.1%), Belarus (9.1%), Bolivia (9.1%), Colombia (9.1%), Cuba (9.1%) Sectors: 015150 (50%), 024040 (50%)",S064084001,70554,151,"Government and civil society, general",,,,,ODA Grants,151,I.5.a.

2430052,,2009,International Monetary Fund (IMF),,Multilaterals,,,,Belarus,BY,Europe,,,1/1/2009,,,No tilte,,"The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a 15-month SDR 1.62 billion (about US$2.46 billion) Stand-By Arrangement for Belarus in support of the country's efforts to adjust to external shocks. The approval makes an amount equivalent to SDR 517.8 million (about US$787.9 million) available immediately. The remainder will be phased thereafter, subject to quarterly reviews. The Stand-By Arrangement entails exceptional access to IMF resources, amounting to 418.8 percent of Belarus's quota. The main objectives of the IMF-supported program are to facilitate an orderly adjustment to external shocks and to address pressing vulnerabilities. To this end, the program contains strong macroeconomic adjustment measures and addresses a number of structural issues that are critical to the adjustment and mitigation of vulnerabilities. Following the Executive Board discussion on Belarus, Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chairman, said: 'Belarus is experiencing serious economic problems. External vulnerabilities have been exposed by adverse terms of trade movements, falling demand from trading partners, and difficulties in securing external finance, leading to a decline in international reserves. In the face of these shocks and the adjustment needed to contain them, the economy is likely to slow in 2009. 'The authorities have a clear strategy to address the challenges they face. They have already adjusted the exchange rate and put in place tight fiscal and wage policies. The measures already taken and announced are strong and, with resolute implementation, will be sufficient to restore stability. Together with planned structural reforms in key areas, these measures should help return the economy to a higher growth path by 2010-11. 'The adjustment of the exchange rate parity will help restore competitiveness and address external imbalances. The adoption of the new currency basket and wider band will leave the economy better able to adapt to external shocks, thus making it less likely that further exchange rate adjustment will be needed. The increase in interest rates that preceded the shift in the exchange rate regime, and their subsequent further upward adjustment, will help support the new exchange rate regime. 'Fiscal tightening will help to bring demand into line with external financing constraints. Key measures include the planned reduction in directed lending, observance of the target of a balanced central government budget balance, and maintenance of a prudent wage policy in the broader public sector. The authorities also plan to review the social safety net, in cooperation with the World Bank, to ensure that the most vulnerable groups are protected against the economic downturn and the effects of utility tariff increases. 'Key structural reforms, including price and wage liberalization, should follow the realignment of the currency. Broader measures to support private sector development-including reductions in the size of government, deregulation, and privatization-are also needed to underpin better medium-term growth, and should be undertaken as fast as market conditions allow. 'Structural reform in the financial sector is an important priority in the program. The authorities have already enacted a blanket deposit guarantee, but the framework for financial sector liquidity and solvency support still needs to be refined. It will also be crucial to purge the banking system of directed lending. Doing so will improve incentives for banks and their borrowers to manage risks, and strengthen banks' capital positions. 'The authorities have developed a strong macroeconomic program to address the challenges Belarus is facing. Their actions merit the substantial financial support that the Fund will provide. The strength of the macroeconomic program gives confidence that Belarus will make a speedy return to stability. If the authorities follow through on their plans for reforms in key structural areas, prospects are also good for a resumption of rapid growth,' Mr. Kato said. Recent Economic Developments Belarus's economic growth has been impressive in the last few years. It has averaged close to 9 percent since 2002, with spare capacity and high investment underpinning production growth, as well as a combination of sharp export price gains, strong growth in trading partners, and large energy subsidies from Russia supporting demand. However, recently the economy has been overheating. Since bottoming in 2006 at 7 percent, inflation has been rising in line with developments in other countries in the region and currently stands at 16 percent. The rise in inflation is partly the result of global food and energy shocks, but indicators of domestic demand, high credit growth, and output growth above trend point to an overheated economy. During the boom, external vulnerabilities were not addressed: international reserves remained low, some Russian energy prices were unwound, and exports to Western markets remained concentrated on oil products, while higher value-added exports were mostly to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). And in the financial sector, credit risks from foreign exchange borrowing and funding exposure to the global banking system have grown. Recent global developments have exposed these vulnerabilities, and as result, the currency peg to the U.S. dollar came under pressure toward the end of 2008. Program Summary Belarus's economic program is designed to facilitate adjustment to external shocks and reduce the vulnerabilities, and also includes a number of structural reforms on issues that are critical to the mitigation of vulnerabilities. A sharp economic slowdown is forecast for 2009, with GDP projected to grow at 1-2 percent, after reaching 10.5 percent in 2008. Inflation is projected to slow to 11.5 percent in 2009. Key features of the program are: • The implementation of a new exchange rate regime. The dollar peg has served the economy well, but the recent volatility of dollar-euro and dollar-ruble rates created significant problems: hindering inflation control on the dollar downside early in 2008, and creating competitiveness issues on the recent upside. The program includes a devaluation to a new dollar parity, with a simultaneous switch to a currency basket that better reflects the structure of Belarus's trade and financial flows, both measures implemented on January 1, 2009. • A tight fiscal stance to contain domestic demand growth. Fiscal tightening measures are aimed directly at slowing investment and consumption. Wage growth will slow in the budget and state enterprise sectors in 2009, and public investment will be restrained. Selected subsidies will be curtailed, but the social safety net will be strengthened to protect the most vulnerable people. • On structural policies, the program places economic liberalization as a priority, particularly price liberalization. The program also envisages efforts to enhance the role of the private sector by reducing the distortion of taxes and the regulatory burden on private companies, and continuing privatization efforts.

2430055,,1995,International Monetary Fund (IMF),,Multilaterals,,,,Belarus,BY,Europe,,,1/1/1995,,,No Title,,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a 12-month stand-by credit for the Republic of Belarus equivalent to SDR 196.3 million (about $293 million) in support of the Government's economic program for 1995/96.  Background  Since its independence in 1992, Belarus has undertaken significant reforms to transform its economy from central planning to one based on market mechanisms, albeit at a somewhat uneven pace. In mid-1994, the newly elected Government adopted measures to restore financial discipline, and steps were taken to sharply reduce the burden of subsidies on the budget. Progress has been achieved in many areas: a tightening of budgetary expenditures in the second half of 1994 allowed for a significant turnaround in the deficit of the general government; prices were freed; and market mechanisms for the allocation of credits by the National Bank of Belarus (NBB) were strengthened. The trade performance improved as well, but progress in reducing inflation remained elusive because of the continuous extension of credit to the ailing sectors of the economy by the NBB. Although inflation has declined sharply during the second quarter of 1995, economic activity continued to contract with the decline of GDP estimated at 11 percent in the first half of the year. Further, implementation of systemic reforms has fallen short of targets, especially in the area of privatization and enterprise reform.  The 1995-96 Program  The broad objectives of the Belarussian authorities' economic program for 1995/96 are to make further progress toward reaching price stability, achieve a sustainable balance of payments position, and establish a market economy, with a view to laying the foundation for sustainable growth. The overall economic objectives aim at limiting the decline of GDP to 13.8 percent in 1995 and 3.0 percent in 1996; containing the rate of monthly inflation to to 1 percent by the end of 1995 and 0.5 percent by the end of 1996; reducing the external current account deficit to around 4 percent of GDP in 1995 and 1996; and building up the level of gross international reserves to the equivalent of 1.7 months of imports by the end of the program period.  To these ends, fiscal policy is centered on reducing the cash defecit of the general governement to 3.2 percent of the GDP for 1995 as a whole. Measures to achieve this include, on the revenue side, increasing excises, limiting tax exemptions, adn strengthening the collection of taxes and social security contributions; and on the expenditure side, containing subsidies and net lending as well as the wage bill and other discretionary outlays. Monetary policy will aim at maintaining poisitve real interest rates and limiting the expansion in base money.  Structural Reform Policies  The Government will further pursue its price liberalization policy, deepen the reforms of the foreign exchange market, and take significant steps in the direction of a comprehensive liberalization of foreign exchange and external trade transactions. It will adopt measures to (i) further reduce barriers to private sector development; (ii) give a clear impetus to the corporatization and privatization process; (iii) encourage enterprises to become financially more responsible and to restructure; and (iv) adopt legislation on private ownership of land.  Addressing Social Costs  Within the budget targets, the authorities will provide financing for a social safety net to partially compensate the most vulnerable groups of the population for the impact of increases in tariffs for household services and utilities.  The Challenge Ahead  Full and sustained implementation of the program will require that the authorities continue to resist pressures from various lobbies for more credit and subsidies; closely monitor the situation of banks; avoid any further deterioration in tax revenue; and implement effectively the program's systemic reforms.  The Republic of Belarus became a member of the IMF on July 10, 1992; its quota1 is SDR 280.4 million (about $418 million), and its outstanding use of IMF credit currently totals SDR 140.2 million (about $209 million).",,,510,General budget support,51010,General budget support,51010.03,Support for implementation of macroeconomic reforms,Not Reported,,,,,51010,General budget support,173193811,0,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,Facility: Standby Arrangement Long Description Found Here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/1995/pr9546.htm,Other,

The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. It is intended that PRGF-supported programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory process involving civil society and development partners, and articulated in a PRSP. This is intended to ensure that PRGF-supported programs are consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and social policies to foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent, and are repayable over 10 years with a 5 ½-year grace period on principal payments.  Following the Executive Board's discussion, Eduardo Aninat, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chairman, said:  'Tajikistan experienced strong economic growth and reduced inflation during the last 18 months. Macroeconomic policies have generally been appropriate, but implementation has been uneven and will need to improve to achieve the objectives of the government's new three-year economic program. Particular attention will need to be paid to monetary policy and structural reform.  'Fiscal performance has been strong over the past two years. Further improvements in tax administration and the tax system will help ensure that adequate resources are available for poverty alleviation. Efforts to raise civil service wages will need to be linked to civil service reform to make the increases sustainable.  'The central bank will need to pursue a more disciplined monetary policy to bring inflation down further. In particular, it should adhere to the commitment to refrain from issuing directed credits. Also the planned restructuring of the central bank to enhance the implementation of monetary policy and improve operational efficiency should be completed as quickly as possible.  'The recent debt rescheduling agreement with Russia, along with the authorities' decision to limit foreign-financed public investment to 3 percent of GDP, have improved the prospects for external debt sustainability. The most recent case of misreporting of data again illustrates the need to strengthen key institutions to prevent a repetition of such incidents. The current case of misreporting of minor and quickly cleared external arrears is regrettable; as this incident relates to the same disbursements for which earlier repayment expectations have been decided by the Board, no additional remedial action is called for.  'The structural reform agenda remains extensive. The recent restructuring of commercial banks and improvements in the regulatory environment have bolstered confidence in the banking system, while important initial steps have been taken to reduce quasi-fiscal deficits in the energy sector. Nevertheless, much more remains to be done. A key reform will be privatization of state-owned farms to enhance resource efficiency and reduce poverty. The recently-completed poverty-reduction strategy paper provides an appropriate framework for the implementation of the structural reforms, ' Mr. Aninat said.  ANNEX  Recent Developments  Tajikistan continues to experience strong growth with increases in GDP averaging 7 percent annually since the end of the civil war in 1997. Much of this growth has been based on the recovery of traditional exports—aluminum and cotton—and there are signs that light manufacturing and private farming are also expanding.  The strong growth in recent years will only be sustained if structural reform is accelerated. Until now structural reform has been erratic due to a narrow base of ownership, weak institutions, uneven political support, inexperience, and a reform agenda that was perhaps too ambitious for the immediate post-civil war period. Given the important link between structural reform and economic growth, Tajikistan's program places great weight on strong structural policies.  Tajikistan has made substantial progress on macroeconomic stabilization although inflation performance has been uneven in recent years mainly due to occasional lapses in monetary policy. The limited development of the financial sector poses challenges for conducting monetary policy. Weak institutional capacity and the lack of a secondary market for treasury bills has precluded the use of open market operations. To improve this situation, the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) is developing an interbank credit market in which it could participate as necessary.  External debt to GDP ratio at 100 percent remains one of the highest in the CIS; debt management capacity is still weak, though there are signs of improvement. The authorities have completed an inventory of government, government-guaranteed, and state-enterprise debts. At present, Tajikistan is current on its external obligations or is in the process of negotiating or rescheduling those debts. The terms of debt service have gradually improved as bilateral debt has been rescheduled on more favorable terms (Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia and Uzbekistan) and concessional borrowing replaced bilateral debt. The authorities have also regularized financial relations between the NBT and the government, by reducing the central bank's portfolio of non-performing loans and ensuring that their respective obligations are settled on market terms.  The major challenges facing Tajikistan's economic reform process are; (a) achieving more extensive ownership of core structural reforms; (b) enhancing stabilization through better implementation of fiscal and monetary policy and (c) restructuring debt and improving debt management.  Program Summary  The program primarily aims to sustain growth, accelerate structural reform, maintain low inflation and exchange rate stability, and strengthen debt management. For the period 2002-2005, the program targets real GDP growth to be at least 5 per cent annually and inflation to decline to 5 per cent by the end of the period. These targets, together with a stable exchange rate, would lead to an improvement in per capita incomes (in U.S. dollar terms) of about 15 per cent over the next several years.  To improve the prospects for sustaining economic growth, the program will implement key structural reforms aimed at eliminating weaknesses in the banking sector, distortions in the energy sector, government interference in the agricultural sector; and weak governance. The NBT will be prohibited from issuing directed credit and making expenditures not related to its core business activities or paying dividends while it has negative net worth. The remaining state-owned farms will be restructured and privatized by the end of 2005 through the issuance of land use and land share certificates. As well, economic governance will be improved by reducing excessive government intervention in economic affairs, enhancing transparency, accountability and economic management.  The program envisions implementation of restrictive fiscal and monetary policies. During this year the overall budget deficit is expected to be ¼ percent of GDP (excluding the foreign-financed public investment program). For the period 2002-2005, only a modest increase in current expenditures to 15 percent of GDP is envisioned in accordance with the program target to maintain tight fiscal control.  One of the program priorities will be to improve debt management and fiscal sustainability. The program will pursue further fiscal consolidation and limit all foreign borrowing. The authorities will not draw on any outstanding non-concessional credit facilities. The program will aim at limiting the size of the foreign-financed public investment program to no more than 3 percent of GDP and to reduce the quasi-fiscal deficit in the energy sector. The recent debt restructuring with Russia will provide significant short-term debt service relief. The Tajik authorities will advise the Iranian authorities that no further borrowing under an Iranian export financing facility will be made by Tajikistan unless the terms of the facility are renegotiated on concessional terms. Over the period 2002 -2005, the program will aim to reduce the current account deficit to below 4 percent of GDP, and gross international reserves to increase to about 3 ½ months of import.  The program will maintain a liberalized trade and investment regime. During the program period, neither the government nor the NBT will, without the approval of the IMF, introduce new or intensify existing restrictions on making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.",,,510,General budget support,51010,General budget support,51010.03,Support for implementation of macroeconomic reforms,Not Reported,,,,,51010,General budget support,131796176,0,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,Facility: PRGF Commitments Long Description Found Here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2002/pr0254.htm,Other,

Main activity(ies): The main activities will be focused around the three major interventions: treatment and care, prevention and setting up of up-to-date monitoring and evaluation system. In the area of treatment the main focus will be on timely detection and treatment of TB cases, training of medical personnel and developing of up-to-date treatment and care guidelines, procurement of 1st and 2nd line anti-TB drugs and testing equipment. The component of care will include work with the most vulnerable groups in prisons and among populations outside of prisons to ensure adherence to treatment and minimum healthy standards of living. It is planned to set up automated National TB Registrar which will be the backbone of the national M&E system and will allow effective monitoring of drug resistance and epidemiological surveillance. Intended results: In 5-years of programme implementation it is planned to provide treatment of about 600 MDR Tb cases nationwide, outpatient treatment of 1000 TB patients representing the most vulnerable groups. Training will be provided to about 350 health care staff annually. National TB Reference Laboratory will be set up and capacities of national TB institutions to do high quality testing and treatment will improve. This should result in improved identification of TB cases by 10% as compared to 2005, increase by 7.8% of successfully treated pulmonary TB cases and decrease of number of registered cases by 5% in year 5.",BLR-607-G02-T,,122,Basic health,12250,Infectious & Parasitic disease control,12250.01|12250.04|12281.01|12181.01,"All prevention and control activities|Tuberculosis control|All staff training, basic health care services|All medical education/training activities",Grant,,,,,12250,Infectious & Parasitic disease control,6452594,0,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,"Project Round:6 Total Funding Request:$14,214,022.00",Screen Scrape Adapter,http://www.theglobalfund.org/programs/grant/?compid=1268&grantid=548&lang=en&CountryId=BLR

PEMPAL is a network of public expenditure management professionals in governments of 21 countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The purpose of the PEMPAL is to support reforms in public expenditure and financial management by promoting capacity development, the exchange of experience and joint learning through so-called Communities of Practice (COP) of budgeting, treasury and internal audit. Benchmarking is used to stimulate peer to peer exchanges, whereas the Public Expenditure Financial Accountability indicators (PEFA) provide the general benchmarking tool and more drill-down specific tools are used for the functional areas covered by the Communities of Practice. The program applies a new approach to capacity development, which emphasizes the need to achieve coherence across three dimensions: (a) the enabling environment; (b) the institutional and policy framework; and (c) the organizational and human resources. Each of these dimensions is envisaged to be addressed under the PEM-PAL. PEM-PAL goes beyond the use of annual face-to-face meetings, by providing a more responsive mechanism for addressing the day-to-day challenges of government officials. PEM-PAL clearly stimulates learning that takes place on-the-job and just-in-time. Beneficiary countries to PEMPAL are Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kyrgyz Republic, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Romania, Russian Federation, Serbia, Tajikistan, Turkey, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. PEMPAL is supported by various donors including SECO, the Russian Government, the World Bank and OECD/Sigma.
